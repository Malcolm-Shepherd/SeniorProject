## Overview

This app will be used by multiple different positions at the same place. The people with Driver position will be able to access routes where they can select one to be displayed on a mapping application as well as check road conditions/local weather reports. The team leaders will be able to assign notes to job sites without internet connection. The people with the scheduling position will have the ability to schedule employees to different jobs based on prerequisites.

## Getting Started

The weather won't work without the api key, once you have it, I recommend you make a file named secret.txt in the lib folder and keep a copy of the key in there. The file secret.txt is added to the .gitignore so it won't be pushed to github, but you will have to clear the key from any other places before a push(the routeDisplay file).
